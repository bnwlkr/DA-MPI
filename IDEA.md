The aim of Delay-Aware MPI (DA-MPI) is to optimize the organization of processes in a parallel computing setting by taking into account inter-node latencies. The system will profile the latencies between nodes, measure the frequencies of communications between nodes during runtime, and potentially provide an extreme (assumption-heavy) process migration framework.

The system should be MPI implementation agnostic.
